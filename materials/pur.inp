*MATERIAL, NAME=Mpur80
*ELASTIC, TYPE=ISO
** We use an isotropic material model, which for foams isn't completely
** correct. The value for ν is set to 0.3 since this is the value I found in
** the literature for PU foam.
** According to available data E = 16 MPa,  G estimated as 8 MPa.
** Calculated: G = 16/(2*(1+0.3)) = 6.15. This is lower than estimated,
** but we keep the value ν = 0.3.
